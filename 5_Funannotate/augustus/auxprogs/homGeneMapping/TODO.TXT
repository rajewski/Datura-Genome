# 9.2.2015

- check if halLiftover is symmetric, meaning that mapping (genome i -> genome j)
  is the same as mapping (genome j -> genome i). If so, halLiftover
  can be reduced to the cases above the diagonal
- add support for other gene features such as UTR exons
- catch exceptions from threads

# 18.12.2015

- write an explanation for the output
- add support for alternative splice froms, e.g. multiple Tx per Gene
- homologous gene clustering: currently 2 transcripts are in the same cluster,
  if all their exons/introns are homologs and their are no additional exons/introns.
  Change this to a less stringend criterion, e.g. at least half of the exon boundaries
  of both transcripts are aligned.
- statistic on exon/intron level: count an exon or intron that occurs in multiple
  transcripts only once
