These parameters on the zoonotic hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum (Pubmed ID 25730766) were contributed by Erich Schwarz (Cornell University):
"Although A. ceylanicum is phylogenetically relatively close to C. elegans, its genome is quite different from that of the latter species, with a three-fold larger size and almost three-fold higher proportion of repetitive DNA elements:

In order to annotate this genome accurately, I generated species-specific AUGUSTUS parameters for Ancylostoma ceylanicum, and used them with AUGUSTUS 2.6.1 to predict protein-coding genes."
