Preprocessing has begun...
Preprocessing is done. Now you have two external work before running correction phase:
(1)Align compressed short reads to compressed long reads using any aligner. Note that multiple alignment option of the aligner should be enabled to benefit from compression.
Compressed short reads file is at: preprocessing//compressed_short.fasta
Compressed long reads file is at: preprocessing//compressed_Dstr.filt_q10_l500_crop50.fastq
(2)Use "samtools sort -m 8G -l 0 | samtools rmdup -S" commands to remove the duplicates in your alignment file (e.g. see utils/afteralignment.sh or utils/runBowtieRmDup.sh)
(3)Run correction phase of Hercules using: 
-The alignment file that you removed its duplicates in (2)
-Original long reads file at /rhome/arajewski/bigdata/Datura/1_QCQA/Dstr.filt_q10_l500_crop50.fastq
-Short reads file at: preprocessing//short.fasta
