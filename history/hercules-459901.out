[bam_sort] -m setting (10K bytes) is less than the minimum required (1M).

Trying to run with -m too small can lead to the creation of a very large number
of temporary files.  This may make sort fail due to it exceeding limits on the
number of files it can have open at the same time.

Please check your -m parameter.  It should be an integer followed by one of the
letters K (for kilobytes), M (megabytes) or G (gigabytes).  You should ensure it
is at least the minimum above, and much higher if you are sorting a large file.
