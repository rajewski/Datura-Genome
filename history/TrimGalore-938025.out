Running Trim Galore on AC1DPA1 ...
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
1.14
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> AC1DPA1LEFT.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	26	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
Nextera	1	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 26). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 1)


SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: AC1DPA1LEFT.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.4.2
Cutadapt version: 1.14
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to AC1DPA1LEFT.gz_trimmed.fq.gz
