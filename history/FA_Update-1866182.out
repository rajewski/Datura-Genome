HAX54_0[09:41 PM]: Manually edit the tbl file Dstr_v1.7_Annotation/update_results/Datura_stramonium.tbl, then run:

funannotate fix -i Dstr_v1.7_Annotation/update_results/Datura_stramonium.gbk -t Dstr_v1.7_Annotation/update_results/Datura_stramonium.tbl

[09:41 PM]: After the problematic gene models are fixed, you can proceed with functional annotation.
[09:41 PM]: Your next step might be functional annotation, suggested commands:
-------------------------------------------------------
Run InterProScan (Docker required): 
funannotate iprscan -i Dstr_v1.7_Annotation/ -m docker -c 10

Run antiSMASH: 
funannotate remote -i Dstr_v1.7_Annotation/ -m antismash -e youremail@server.edu

Annotate Genome: 
funannotate annotate -i Dstr_v1.7_Annotation/ --cpus 10 --sbt yourSBTfile.txt
