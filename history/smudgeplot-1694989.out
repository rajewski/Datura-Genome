!! Careful, your coverage filter on the lower end (L = 	150.5	) is higher than half of the 1n coverage estimate ( 1n / 2 = 	81.28
If the real 1n coverage is half of your estimate you would not picked it up due to the filtering.
Consider reruning the analysis with lover L as well (something like (1n / 2) - 5 should do the job)
Another good way for verificaiton would be to compare it to GenomeScope estimate of haploid coverage
