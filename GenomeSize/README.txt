The directory Results_Trial_Seq is the output files from my first attempt at using kmers to estimate heterzygosity and genome size. I used as input data, the small trial run of sequencing for Datura that we got as part of our library prep. This gave very inconsistent results and I hypothesized that it could be an artifact of low coverage. To test this, I downloaded some resequencing data from an Arabidopsis ecotype and reran the scripts on this data, and then subsampled this data to lower coverage and repeated to confirm that the wonky results are due to low coverage. The script subsample.sh is used to randomly subsample the *.fq file

The script kmer.sh is a single script that makes a kmer plot at several values of K for a given *.fq file. This script should really only be used if you have to. The script kmer_array.sh does the same thing except it runs as an array job, with the array number being the k to test. So this can be submitted as an array job with array=11,13,19, for instance.

I have tested this qith various coverages of data and depending on the kmer size, I can get an estimate of genome size similar to the value from Kew. I am now (22 May 19) attempting this will all of my data after it has been quality filtered and trimmed for adapters with Trimmomatic.

The R script, SizeEstimates.R is used to make the plots of the jellyfish output and to actually caluclate the genome size from these plots.
